# Some kind of snake aka. Learning Project

This should become a little project to test some technologies inspired by [JsUnconf17](http://2017.jsunconf.eu/).

## Base
* Vue.js
* immutable.js for functional programming in js
* unexpected.js for testing

Don't know if all of this is easy to combine - but - let's try.

## Idea
Play snake to get provided information stept by step (e.g. a CV).
